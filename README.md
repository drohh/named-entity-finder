# sent-to-ents
A Flask web app which uses an NLP model from spaCy to identify and classify objects in user-inputed sentences. In other words, the app identifies entities in English sentences. This was developed by strictly following TDD principles, with the most important one being: *"Only write code to satisfy tests or to create a new test."*
